# TrajectoryScanningExperiments
This repository contains scripts that were used to generate the results in the paper **Scalable Spatial Scan Statistics for Trajectories**. The algorithms used in the paper are located in the `pyscan repository
<https://github.com/michaelmathen/pyscan/tree/TrajectoryPaper>`_ under the TrajectoryPaper tag. These scripts are for running various spatial and combinatorial error tests.
